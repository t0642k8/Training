# Live Events

## Broadcast to Azure

Azure Media Services offers Live internet broadcast of events. Events like Olympics in 2012
were broadcasted on Azure Media Service throughout the world. The process of setting up a show
is highly complicated, because we dont have the benifit of a comercial software like Ragnar it is 
highly suggested to utilize the checklist to complete the setup properly.

Checklist for before.
